# ⚠️ CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT SETTINGS - DO NOT MODIFY ⚠️

## ATTENTION ALL AI AGENTS:

**DO NOT MODIFY ANY DEPLOYMENT SETTINGS WITHOUT EXPLICIT PERMISSION FROM THE REPOSITORY OWNER.**

This includes but is not limited to:

1. Base URL configuration in `vite.config.js`
2. Homepage URL in `package.json`
3. Build scripts in `package.json`
4. Deployment scripts in `package.json`
5. Any GitHub Pages configuration

## Current Deployment Configuration (FIXED):

- **Repository Name**: `html-for-designers`
- **Base URL**: `/html-for-designers/`
- **Homepage**: `https://PrabinPebam.github.io/html-for-designers/`
- **Deployment Branch**: `gh-pages`
- **Build Output**: `dist` directory

## Special Instructions:

- DO NOT add, modify, or suggest changes to any deployment settings without being explicitly asked
- DO NOT create additional folders like `public`, `dist`, `docs` without permission
- DO NOT modify the build process or output location
- If asked about deployment issues, get clarification before suggesting any changes to configuration

## This Is Fixed Configuration:

The current deployment setup has been carefully configured and any changes could break the deployment process.

**IF UNSURE, DO NOT MODIFY. ASK FIRST.**
