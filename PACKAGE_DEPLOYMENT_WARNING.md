# ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING: PACKAGE.JSON DEPLOYMENT SETTINGS ⚠️

## DO NOT MODIFY WITHOUT EXPLICIT PERMISSION

The `package.json` file contains critical deployment settings that should not be modified without explicit permission from the repository owner.

## Protected Settings:

- **"homepage"**: `https://PrabinPebam.github.io/html-for-designers/`
- **"build"** script
- **"deploy"** script
- **"predeploy"** script

## Instructions for AI Assistants:

- DO NOT suggest or implement changes to any of the above settings
- DO NOT modify the build process or output directories
- DO NOT add new deployment-related dependencies without explicit permission

Any unauthorized changes to these settings can break the deployment process and cause significant problems.

**ALWAYS ASK BEFORE MODIFYING ANY DEPLOYMENT-RELATED CONFIGURATION.**
